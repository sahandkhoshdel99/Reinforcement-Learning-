Two of the computer assignments given in this graduate course are uploaded on my profle.
## HW#1 mainly consists of a breif review on statistics which underlay RL and ML. CLT, Parameter Estimation and Hypothesis testing are discussed along with simulations. 
## HW#4 is about On-policy methods and their optimization and evaluation through a simple grid search.
